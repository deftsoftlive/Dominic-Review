By doing this, no matter whether it&#39;s at tennis, another sport or at school/work, you&#39;ll improve and are more likely to succeed. Dedication is arguably the most important aspect of tennis development.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-12">\r\n<hr /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-sm-3">\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:48px;"><strong>Respect</strong></span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt="" src="https://myfiles.space/user_files/71192_1c6ea7a2a641449a/71192_custom_files/Respect.png" /></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-9">\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style="font-size:20px;">Respect in tennis can come in many forms. Having respect for yourself, your opponents, your teammates, your coach and others who support you is key.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking. If this is not the correct number, please inform us by email to tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to do if you can&#39;t attend a class:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are unable to attend the class and you want to make up the session you will need to contact the Head Coach&nbsp;<u><strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong></u>the session is missed. Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them. If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest. If you&#39;re interested in attending more than one coaching class per week, starting 1to1 lessons or have any questions about your or your child&#39;s development then please speak with your group class coach.</font></font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Individual lessons:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Our DRH Sports tennis coaches offer 1to1 lessons for all those who want to take their development to the next level. Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups.

Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them. If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest. If you&#39;re interested in attending more than one coaching class per week, starting 1to1 lessons or have any questions about your or your child&#39;s development then please speak with your group class coach.</font></font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Individual lessons:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Our DRH Sports tennis coaches offer 1to1 lessons for all those who want to take their development to the next level. Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking. If this is not the correct number, please inform us by email to tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to do if you can&#39;t attend a class:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are unable to attend the class and you want to make up the session you will need to contact the Head Coach&nbsp;<u><strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong></u>the session is missed. Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them. If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class.

Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes.

If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest. If you&#39;re interested in attending more than one coaching class per week, starting 1to1 lessons or have any questions about your or your child&#39;s development then please speak with your group class coach.</font></font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Individual lessons:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Our DRH Sports tennis coaches offer 1to1 lessons for all those who want to take their development to the next level. Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking. If this is not the correct number, please inform us by email to tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to do if you can&#39;t attend a class:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are unable to attend the class and you want to make up the session you will need to contact the Head Coach&nbsp;<u><strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong></u>the session is missed. Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them. If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups.

The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest.

Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking. If this is not the correct number, please inform us by email to tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to do if you can&#39;t attend a class:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are unable to attend the class and you want to make up the session you will need to contact the Head Coach&nbsp;<u><strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong></u>the session is missed. Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them.

If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest. If you&#39;re interested in attending more than one coaching class per week, starting 1to1 lessons or have any questions about your or your child&#39;s development then please speak with your group class coach.</font></font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Individual lessons:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Our DRH Sports tennis coaches offer 1to1 lessons for all those who want to take their development to the next level. Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals.

Just speak to your group coach for more information.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>MEDICAL EQUIPMENT&nbsp;</strong>- If you or your child has a medical condition which requires equipment such as inhalers then we ask that they are brought to each class.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking. If this is not the correct number, please inform us by email to tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to do if you can&#39;t attend a class:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are unable to attend the class and you want to make up the session you will need to contact the Head Coach&nbsp;<u><strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong></u>the session is missed. Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them. If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups. If sessions do need to be cancelled or if we need to notify you of upcoming events or changes then we will contact you via a WhatsApp group we will create for your session.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease make sure that you are added to the coaching session WhatsApp group if you haven&#39;t been by the second week of the term.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;</u>The WhatsApp groups are used solely for communicating tennis club/coaching club matters and are not used by coaches, players or parents for any other reason.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to Wear:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Players should wear comfortable clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and wear comfortable trainers,&nbsp;ideally ones specific to tennis, no heelys, flip-flops or sandals. Long hair should be tied back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note, we do not hold spare clothing at the tennis club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><strong>WhatsApp Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;We will use the telephone number attached to the account used to make the booking. If this is not the correct number, please inform us by email to tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>What to do if you can&#39;t attend a class:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are unable to attend the class and you want to make up the session you will need to contact the Head Coach&nbsp;<u><strong>BEFORE&nbsp;</strong></u>the session is missed. Classes can be made up at a later stage in the term provided you let the Head Coach know at least 24 hours prior to the missed class and that there is available space in the class you intend to join. Missed classes must be made up within the intended term and cannot be carried over to future terms or be held in credit for other participants, camps or courses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Moving up to the next level:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">We endeavour to progress each player in our programme at the right stage for them.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class.

If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest. If you&#39;re interested in attending more than one coaching class per week, starting 1to1 lessons or have any questions about your or your child&#39;s development then please speak with your group class coach.</font></font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Individual lessons:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Our DRH Sports tennis coaches offer 1to1 lessons for all those who want to take their development to the next level. Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

This is because our two entrances are at either end of the courts, which means that you have to walk across one court to get to another. This means that there is a risk of games and matches being interrupted by people walking at the back of courts or even the potential of people being hit by tennis balls.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilton Keynes Tennis Club asks that all players and parents stop and wait the play to finish and for acknowledgement by those playing before walking behind the tennis courts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>The weather and cancellations:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We always try our best to run all classes regardless of the weather conditions, however there may be times when the weather conditions mean that it&#39;s unsuitable or unsafe to run the class. If this is the case, we may need to cancel the class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is a cancellation you will be notified no less than 15 minutes&nbsp;before the lesson via WhatsApp and social media. Any lesson that is&nbsp;cancelled by us can be made up by the participant by attending any of our other classes that run that term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we are more than 15 minutes into the lesson and the weather becomes unsuitable, the session is deemed to have started and no makeup session will be provided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, we may arrange a make up class for cancelled classes. These classes will be made up at a time that is suitable for the coach.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s important that we have the ability to communicate quickly and easily with the players (or parents of) within our coaching groups.

If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play.

Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

If this means that they need to be moved up mid term, then we&#39;ll do this. As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">There is no substitute&nbsp;for regular play. The best way to improve and progress is to play more often. Those who attend multiple coaching classes and have 1to1 lessons will improve the fastest. If you&#39;re interested in attending more than one coaching class per week, starting 1to1 lessons or have any questions about your or your child&#39;s development then please speak with your group class coach.</font></font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Individual lessons:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Our DRH Sports tennis coaches offer 1to1 lessons for all those who want to take their development to the next level. Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

Not only can you create a competition, but you can create multiple match reports, add match details, scores and feedback. You can also add in any match charting and match stat data. Our system will then be able to show you the match stats for your player. Here&#39;s what you need to do:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>1) </strong>Select the player from the list and create the competition (if you are a parent or player, only people listed in your account will show. If you are a coach then only players linked to you will show). Then click SUBMIT.<br />\r\n<strong>2)</strong> Create the first match, include the details along with your feedback about what went well, what could be improved and any further feedback.<br />\r\n<strong>3) </strong>Upload match charting images if you wish. You don&#39;t have to do this, but it can be good to show a player if you have them.<br />\r\n<strong>4) </strong>Click SUBMIT - You&#39;ll then see the match linked to the competition and can add another match if you wish. You can also then go the match you have just entered and add in the match stats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe hope you enjoy this and all the other DRH Tennis Pro features.

Whilst the groups classes are essential for learning not only the basics in technique and tactics, every player is different, and therefore will have different requirements. 1to1 lessons give our team the opportunity to work more closely with players and give them bespoke advice and instruction that will enable their game to improve more quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe recommend that all players look at getting some 1to1 lessons at some point in their tennis journey so if this is something that interests you, please speak with your session coach or email tenniscoaching@drhsports.co.uk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Feedback:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><font color="#000000"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><font style="font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial">At DRH Sports we rely on feedback from players and parents in order for us to grow and improve.

As a general rule of thumb, our goal is to get all CLUB group players to a stage where they can rally not only with a coach, but with another player of the same age from the back of the court. Once this is achieved, then we&#39;ll look to move the player up to the next level and will recommend competition play.</font></font><br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<br style="color:#757575; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />\r\n<font color="#000000"><font style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2; text-align:left; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:#ffffff; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial">There is no substitute for regular play.
